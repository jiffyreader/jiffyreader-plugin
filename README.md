# What is Faster Reading?
This extension provides faster reading through facilitating the reading process by bolding half the words.
As a result, the reader is only focusing on the bolded initial letters and lets the brain autocomplete the words. This allows you to read faster.

# Help with Translations
  JiffyReader is in need of translation help for what ever language you can.
  To help: 
  1. Please check that the language you would like to help with has not already been taken up by someone else by looking through both the open and closed tickets for translations.
  2. Open an issue ticket and add the `translation` label to it along with the name of the language you want to translate. Use this [shortcut link to open a new ticket](https://github.com/ansh/jiffyreader.com/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+Give+a+suitable+title)
  3. Copy either the english locale json  [click here](https://github.com/ansh/jiffyreader.com/blob/master/assets/_locales/en/messages.json) or spanish local json [click here](https://github.com/ansh/jiffyreader.com/blob/master/assets/_locales/es/messages.json) translate into the language you can assist with using your preferred editor or even Microsoft Word. 
  4. Indicate the language you would like to help translate in the ticket title. This helps to eliminate duplicate work.

  - Attach any questions or updates to the ticket you are working on and someone will try and get to them within a day or two.
   
   ## Working with the translation files.
   The translation files are json formats. You only need to worry about translating the text associated with the message key.
   ```
    <!-- example -->
    "exampleText":{
      "message": "this is the text to translate",
      "description": "it is not required to translate this text"
    }
    ```

    - result after translation into spanish
    
    ```
    "exampleText":{
      "message": "esto es el texto a traducir",
      "description": "it is not required to translate this text"
    }

   ```

   ## Submitting your translations
   - You can email the translated file or paste the entire translation as a new comment in the ticket you opened and we will take it from there.
   - Don't forget to indicate your name for attribution.

  # Supported languages
  1. English: by JiffyReader maintainer
  2. Spanish: by JiffyReader maintainer
  3. Others coming soon: contributor name

  JiffyReader has been updated to support displaying information in multiple languages thanks to a strong interest and constant emails and enquiries about it.
